How do you calculate Category 1 commitments for each entity?

For libraries that receive a commitment when applying as a single entity, we take the total from the "FRN Line Total Post-Discount Cost" field (API field name - post_discount_extended_eligible_line_item_costs).

For libraries that receive a commitment when applying as a library system or as a member of a consortium, we take the total from the "FRN Line Total Post-Discount Cost" field (API field name - post_discount_extended_eligible_line_item_costs)
and divide it by the total number of recipients that have the same "Funding Request Line Item Number" (API field name - form_471_line_item_number). We are not aware of data available within the commitments data set that shows the actual allocation of funding per recipient
and so arrived at this method for estimating the commitments among a group of recipients.


Let's look at an application (211031862) from Acadia Parish Library and each funding request in a little bit more detail.

In this example, we'll look at the From 471 from Acadia Parish Library (http://publicdata.usac.org/SL/Prd/Form471/346147/221007497/Original/USAC_FCC_FORM_471_APPLICATION_221007497_CERTIFIED.pdf)
includes two funding requests, each with a single Funding Request Line Item Number. Each of the Funding Request Numbers covers 7 entities - 
the main library and 6 branches - for a total of 7 recipients for each funding request.

Funding Request 1 - FRN 2199057816 and FRN Line Item 2199057816.001
The total from the "FRN Line Total Post-Discount Cost" field for the first FRN and line item request is $15,109.20. As there are 7 recipients, each of the recipients is estimated to have received $2,158.45.

Funding Request 2 - FRN  2199057982 and FRN Line Item  2199057982.001
The total from the "FRN Line Total Post-Discount Cost" field for the second FRN and line item request is $67,964.40. As there are 7 recipients, each of the recipients is estimated to have received $9,709.20.

If we look up Church Point Branch in the recipient view on the E-Rate Dashboard, the following totals for Funding Year 2021 for Category 1 is returned: $11,867.66	
This total comes from the two FRN line items, with FRN 2199057816 adding in $2,158.45 and FRN 2199057982 adding in $9,709.20 for a total of $11,867.65.

All data for estimated commitments is pulled from the following data set:

This application from Shreve Memorial Library shows another example in a different format. http://publicdata.usac.org/SL/Prd/Form471/346197/221006892/Original/USAC_FCC_FORM_471_APPLICATION_221006892_CERTIFIED.pdf
