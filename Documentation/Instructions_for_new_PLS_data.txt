When a new Public Library Survey (PLS) dataset becomes available, follow these steps:

1. Rename the comma-separated-values (CSV) data files as follows:
  {Year}_IMLS_PLS_AE.csv (e.g. 2045_IMLS_PLS_AE.csv)
  {Year}_IMLS_PLS_OUTLET.csv (e.g. 2045_IMLS_PLS_OUTLET.csv)
  {Year}_IMLS_PLS_STATE.csv (e.g. 2045_IMLS_PLS_STATE.csv)
2. Add the datasets to the AWS s3 bucket: s3://erate-data/data/IMLS_PLS/ 
3. Update the code in the rmd file called "Merging_IMLS_AEs_and_Outlets_by_Year.Rmd" (https://github.com/tascha/E-Rate/blob/main/Code/Merging_IMLS_AEs_and_Outlets_by_Year.Rmd). This will require reading through the whole script as small changes will be needed throughout.
  a. add code to read in the newest datasets for PLS Outlets and AEs 
  b. add the new dataframes to the list of dataframes used throughout the merge script
  c. rename dataframes and output files to include the new year (e.g. 2014-2045_All_Unique_Entities_Most_Recent_PLS.csv")
  d. run the updated code
4. Update the code in the R script called "USAC_PLS_Matching_Script.R" (https://github.com/tascha/E-Rate/blob/main/Code/USAC_PLS_Matching_Script.R)
  a. Update the name of the data file that is read in to make the dataframe called "IMLS". This is the same file that was created after running step 3.
  b. run the updated code
5. Update the code in the R script called "EC2_Script_No_Matching.R" (https://github.com/tascha/E-Rate/blob/main/Code/EC2_Script_No_Matching.R)
  a. Update the name of the data file (and do a find/replace for the dataframe name) that is read in to make the dataframe called "imls_2014to{EndYear}".
  b. Replace the code on the EC2 instance with the updated code created in this step.
6. Check the dashboard once step 5 has been run and make sure the newest data is appearing
