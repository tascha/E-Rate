Libraries can apply as different types of entities in the E-Rate program - either a library, library system, or as part of a consortium.

If you want to find the total participants or commitments to library entities in the E-Rate program then you need to account for all three types of entity type applications. 

Consortium can have both library and school members, so we needed a process to pull out the library members within a consortium and came up with the following 
filtering process to capture the library members of consortiums and pull those totals into our calculations.


*NOTE: We also filter for all commitments data on the FRN Status (API field name = form_471_frn_status_name) = FUNDED


Filtering to include libraries within consortium methodology in the Commitments dataset

Step 1. General filtering to include the largest possible group of entities while excluding schools
When retrieving data from the Commitments dataset (avi8-svp9), first filter the field "Billed Entity Type" (API field name ='organization_entity_type_name') to keep any of the following: 
- Library
- Library System
- Consortium

The other options are for "school" and school district" which will be excluded moving forward. We have now narrowed the entities considerably by looking at a much more limited set of Billed Entities that excludes schools.

Step 2. Filter to find library entities through a partial string match and to find non-instructional facilities in the Recipients Entity Type field
Then filter on "Recipient Entity Type" (API field name = "ros_entity_type"). Searching within this field we want to keep anything that contains the letter combination "libr" AND anything of the type "non-instructional facility (nif)"

In this step, we refine the filter by adding in a filter on the types of recipients. This allows us to include any library entity that is particiapting as part of a consortium and also allows us to find Non-Instructional Facilities that we think are associated with libraries based on their name. 

Step 3. Refine filters of Recipients Entity Type field in combination with the Billed Entity Type field to eliminate non-library NIFs
Filter to keep anything that meets any of the following conditions
- "Recipient Entity Type" (API field name = "ros_entity_type") contains the letter string "libr"
- "Recipient Entity Type" (API field name = "ros_entity_type") equals "non-instructional facility (nif)" AND "Billed Entity Type" (API field name ='organization_entity_type_name') contains the letter combination "libr"
- "Recipient Entity Type" (API field name = "ros_entity_type") equals "non-instructional facility (nif)" AND "Billed Entity Type" (API field name ='organization_entity_type_name') equals "consortium" AND "Recipient Entity Type" (API field name = "ros_entity_type")
contains the letter combination "libr"

We use these filters to eliminate any NIFs that are not library-related

Step 4. Filter to include any other library but not schools
Finally, filter to keep anything in Recipient Subtype (API field name=ros_subtype) that meets the following conditions:
- is n/a (null value)
- does not contain the letter combination "public school"
